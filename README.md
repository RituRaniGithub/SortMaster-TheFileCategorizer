# SortMaster-TheFileCategorizer

Sort Master is a Python-based tool that helps you sort and categorize your files based on their extensions. It provides a  user-controlled approach to organizing your files, allowing you to specify the directory path for sorting. 

## Usage
1. Run the FileCategorizer Python script.
2. Enter the directory path for the files you want to sort.
3. FileCategorizer will create folders for each unique file extension and move the files to their corresponding folders.
4. Enjoy your well-organized file collection!

## Acknowledgement
This project is inspired by AlextheAnalyst's Automated file sorter. AlextheAnalyst suggested the idea of adding a timer to automate the file-sorting process at regular intervals. While that's an excellent suggestion, I took a different approach by allowing users to manually input the path and categorize the files. With the assistance of ChatGPT, the development process was made more efficient and less time-consuming. I would like to express my gratitude to AlextheAnalyst for the inspiration and to ChatGPT for its valuable assistance in bringing this project to life.
